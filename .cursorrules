- Leverage Astro's built-in components like <Markdown /> when appropriate.

Routing and Pages

- Utilize Astro's file-based routing system in the src/pages/ directory.
- Implement dynamic routes using [...slug].astro syntax.
- Use getStaticPaths() for generating static pages with dynamic routes.

Content Management

- Leverage Astro's built-in support for frontmatter in Markdown files.
- Implement content collections for organized content management.

Styling

- Always prefer Tailwind CSS instead of pure CSS.
- Leverage global styles when necessary, importing them in layouts.
- Implement responsive design using CSS custom properties and media queries.

Performance Optimization

- Use the client:\* directives judiciously for partial hydration:
  - client:load for immediately needed interactivity
  - client:idle for non-critical interactivity
  - client:visible for components that should hydrate when visible
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
- Utilize Astro's built-in asset optimization features.

Data Fetching

- Use Astro.props for passing data to components.
- Implement getStaticPaths() for fetching data at build time.
